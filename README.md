# Memevertisement-DB Project

## Overview

This academic project models the database and business processes for **MEMEvertisement** – a fictional organization that
provides marketing content creation services through innovative meme creation, sticker design and GIF generation.
It demonstrates various SQL features, including basic queries, nested queries, triggers, stored procedures, and more.
The accompanying PDF report provides a detailed ERD model, business logic, and explanations for each query.
